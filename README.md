# IPdate
Get notifications every time your public or private IP changes.

## Usage
### OS X
Open Terminal, and type `cd ` (make sure to include a space afterwards). Then, drag and drop the downloaded folder into the window. It should look something like: `cd /User/username/Downloads/IPdate`. Next, hit enter.  

Now, still using terminal, type in `python send.py` to execute the script. Follow the instructions and enter the email you wish to have it send to.

Done!
